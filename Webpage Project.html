<H2>!Welcome!</H2>

<P>
My name is Margaret and I am a psychology major here at UGA. I am originally from Tucker, GA but my family and <br>
I moved to Marietta for high school. I am trying to decide whether to get my masters in "animal" psychology, also known as <br>
behavioral biology, or in clinical psychology. This is a tough decision because I love animals and I think they are super neat. <br>
I also really enjoy helping people. <I>Eventually</I> I will have to choose, but for now I can do both! Below are more things I enjoy!</P>
<ul>
<H4>Margaret's Hobbies</H4>

<P>As I said before, I also <B>love</B> animals. To the left is one of my family cats, Bastet.<br>
Her and her brother Sekhemet are very sweet! I do not have a picture of him though.<br>
To the right is a video of a turtle I saw! He was a Florida Soft-Shelled turtle. Beth Cavener <br>
is a scientific illustrator/sculptor who does sculptures of carious animals. Her work is beautiful and the designs are meticulously etched in by hand.
The poses can be sort of gruesome, but the detail is very dream like. 
<A href="http://www.followtheblackrabbit.com/">I encourage you to check out her work!</A> <br>

I hope you enjoyed my webpage and my animals as much as I did! Have a good day!
